# Ultra-Fighters

A 3D Super Fighters Remake

[The Original that Inspired Me](http://www.twoplayergames.org/play/592-Super_Fighters.html)

This game is just a prototype so far and its developing pretty slowly, but steadily. As this is my first time with 
a 3D game, I'm learning at every turn so don't expect this to be the next Black Ops or whatever. 
So far this program works only on Mac OS X. I have a theory that with just a little effort on the building and 
compiling side of things that this would work on Linux as well. As for Windows, you're gonna have a bad time: I 
really hate windows and seeing as this program was made by a guy that has 99% development time on Unix systems, 
it'll be a struggle to get this to run on Windows.


### How to Run

Step 1: If you are not using a computer that runs OS X, either turn away now and cry, or fork this repo and try to 
get it working on your system of choice, and tell me when you do it ;)

Step 2: Just click "Download as ZIP", slide on over to the "bin/OSX" folder in that downloaded folder and open 
"Ultra-Fighters.app"

Step 3: Enjoy!
