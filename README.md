# Ultra-Fighters

A 3D Super Fighters Remake

[The Original that Inspired Me](http://www.twoplayergames.org/play/592-Super_Fighters.html)

This game is just a prototype so far and its developing pretty slowly, but steadily. As this is my first time with 
a 3D game, I'm learning at every turn so don't expect this to be the next Black Ops or whatever. 
So far this program works only on Mac OS X (and El Capitan at that, but that'll be fixed shortly). I have a theory
that with just a little effort on the building and compiling side of things that this would work on Linux as well.
As for Windows, you're gonna have a bad time: I really hate windows and seeing as this program was made by a guy 
that has 99% development time on Unix systems, it'll be a struggle to get this to run on Windows.

### How to Install

Step 1: If you are not using a Mac that runs OS X El Capitan or higher, either turn away now and cry, or fork this 
repo and try to get it working on your system of choice, and tell me when you do it ;)

Step 2: Just click "Download as ZIP", slide on over to the "Mac" folder in that downloaded folder and click 
"Ultra-Fighters.app"

Step 3: Enjoy!
