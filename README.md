# Ultra-Fighters

A 3D Super Fighters Remake

[The Original that Inspired Me](http://www.twoplayergames.org/play/592-Super_Fighters.html)

This game is just a prototype so far and its developing pretty slowly, but steadily. As this is my first time with 
a 3D game, I'm learning at every turn so don't expect this to be the next Black Ops or whatever (It's still cool). 
So far this program doesn't work on Linux (Sorry!). I have a theory that with just a little effort on the building and 
compiling side of things that this would work on Linux as well though.


How to Run
----

### OS X


Step 1: Click 'Download ZIP'

Step 2: Go on over to the "bin/OSX" folder in that downloaded folder and open "Ultra-Fighters.app". Since the app contains the resources, you 
can move the app around wherever you want and it will still work!

Step 3: Enjoy!

### Windows (32 bit)

Step 1: Click 'Download ZIP'

Step 2: Go on over to the "bin/Win32" folder in that downloaded folder and open "Ultra-Fighters.exe". You can drag the executable around
wherever you want, but make sure to keep the Resources folder in the same folder as the exe.

Step 3: Enjoy!

### Windows (64 bit)

Step 1: Click 'Download ZIP'

Step 2: Go on over to the "bin/Win64" folder in that downloaded folder and open "Ultra-Fighters.exe". You can drag the executable around
wherever you want, but make sure to keep the Resources folder in the same folder as the exe. 

Step 3: Enjoy!
